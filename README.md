Movie Selector

Overview:
Final Project Descrption Movie Selector You work at the movie theatre and a customer walks up to you at the ticket booth. They ask you to recommend them a movie to watch because they are indescive. You can't think of a movie that person would enjoy because it may not pertain to their interests.

About my Program:
The Movie Selector will help users to choose a movie they may like. The Movie Selector will ask you which genre in movies you prefer to watch. It will then give you the synopsis of selection of movies based on the genre. The code will display the output; the movie title and the summary. If the movie does not seem appealing to you based on the summary you can choose 7 to exit and restart. Some future improvements I may want to implement is if a user is still unsure of what movie to watch they can choose a randomizer which has the program choose for them. I also want to list multiple movies. This is unrealistic in movie theatres but the app can be used anywhere and anytime.
